description: Treatment of definite articles in German
---

### Definite articles
German nouns have one of three genders: **masculine**, **feminine**, or **neuter**.

While they sometimes correspond to a *natural gender* ("der Mann" is male), most often the gender will depend on the word, not on the object it describes. This is called *grammatical gender*.

Each gender has its own definite article. *Der* is used for masculine nouns, *die* for feminine, and *das* for neuter.

### Generic vs. specific
Just like in English, using or dropping the definite article makes the difference between specific and generic:

**General**
I like bread = *Ich mag Brot*

**Specific**
I like the bread = *Ich mag das Brot*
