## Capitalizing nouns
In German, all nouns are capitalized. For example, "my name" is *mein Name*, and "the apple" is *der Apfel*. This helps you identify which words are the nouns in a sentence.

## German genders are strange
Nouns in German are either **feminine**, **masculine**, or **neuter**. For example, *die Frau* (woman) is feminine, *der Mann* (man) is masculine, and *das Kind* (child) is neuter.

It is important to learn every noun along with its gender because parts of German sentences change depending on the gender of their nouns.

For now, just remember that the indefinite article (a/an) *ein* is used for masculine and neuter nouns, and *eine* is used for feminine nouns.

## Verb conjugations

### Conjugating regular verbs
To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, identify the stem of the verb and add the ending corresponding to any of the grammatical persons:

* ich trink**e**
* du trink**st**
* er/sie/es trink**t**

### Conjugating irregular verbs
Irregular verbs such as *sein* are completely irregular and their conjugations simply need to be memorized:

* ich **bin**
* du **bist**
* er/sie/es **ist**

## Umlauts
Umlauts are letters (more specifically vowels) that have two dots above them and appear in some German words like *Mädchen*. Umlauts can be added to *a*, *o*, and *u* forming *ä*, *ö*, and *ü*, respectively.

An umlaut changes how the vowel sounds and may change the meaning of the word.

## No continuous aspect
In German, there's no continuous aspect. There are no separate forms for "I drink" and "I am drinking". There's only one form: *Ich trinke.*

## German plurals are also strange
In some languages (such as French or Spanish), genders are also differentiated in the plural. In German, the plural form does not depend on what gender the singular form is. Regardless of grammatical gender, all plural nouns take the definite article *die*. This does not make them feminine. Like in English, there's no plural indefinite article:

* a man → ein Mann
* men → Männer

## You, you and you
In German, when addressing a single person, use *du*:

* **Du bist mein Kind.**

If you are talking to more than one person, use *ihr*:

* **Ihr seid meine Kinder.**

Note that these only work for people you are familiar with (friends, family, etc.). For others, you would use the formal "you”, *Sie*.

## Verb conjugations
Here is a table for conjugating regular verbs and the irregular verb *sein*:

**Regular**          | **Irregular**
---------------------|------------------
ich trink**e**       | ich **bin**
du trink**st**       | du **bist**
er/sie/es trink**t** | er/sie/es **ist**
wir trink**en**      | wir **sind**
ihr trink**t**       | ihr **seid**
sie/Sie trink**en**  | sie/Sie **sind**
