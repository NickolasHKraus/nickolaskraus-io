## Common phrases
Commonly used phrases are often shortened versions of a longer sentence. Or they might be leftovers from some old grammar that has otherwise fallen out of use. Rest assured, these abbreviated phrases have formal counterparts, which reveal the proper grammatical structure of the phrase.

## Wie geht's?
There are many ways to ask someone how they are doing. In German, the idiomatic phrase uses the verb *gehen* (to go). The formal salutation is *Wie geht es dir*, literally "How goes it to you". However, this can be shortened to simply *Wie geht's*. In German, the dative case is used to denote the receiver of the direct (accusative) object, which need not be present. In cases such as this, German does not use a corporal perspective when describing one's well-being or physical state. Instead, one asks or tells how something is *to them*. As such, a typical response to *Wie geht's'* would be *Mir geht's gut* or *Mir geht's schlecht*. It would be ungrammatical to say *Ich gehe gut*.

## Willkommen can be a false friend
In German, *Willkommen* means welcome as in "Welcome to our home", but it does not mean welcome as in "You're welcome". *Willkommen* is typically used in a formal greeting such as, *Herzlich willkommen!*

## Entschuldigung!
Sometimes, German words can be a mouthful. Later on, we will find that you can take long words apart, and recognize the meaning from its constituent elements.

**Part**   | **Meaning**
-----------|------------
ent-       | de-
Schuld     | guilt
-ig        | -y
-gung      | noun suffix

So, *Entschuldigung* literally means something like "deguiltification", but it can be used in cases where "Excuse me" or "Sorry" are appropriate.
