## Overview
Japanese uses three different writing systems, **hiragana**, **katakana**, and **kanji**.

* **Hiragana** is the most basic Japanese syllabary. It's like an alphabet that uses syllables instead of individual sounds.
* **Katakana** is the syllabary used to write foreign words and some noises. Although it's different from hiragana, it represents the exact same 
syllables.
* **Kanji** are Chinese characters used in the Japanese language to write individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Kanji are not phonetic, meaning you need to memorize each pronunciation individually.

## Introduction to Kanji
This article introduces the non-phonetic writing system of Japanese, **kanji**. Kanji literally means "Chinese characters," and they're used to build content words like nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

### Kanji Readings
Most kanji have at least two possible readings. Typically, one reading is derived from a native Japanese word, and one reading is derived from a Chinese loanword. These are called *kunyomi* ("meaning reading") and *onyomi* ("sound reading") respectively.

For example, let's take the kanji for "country," 国。On its own, we use the Japanese "kunyomi" reading, くに。In Japanese, くに means "country." However, in compounds, we use the "onyomi" reading of こく。Therefore, China, 中国 or "middle country," is read as ちゅうごく。

### Rendaku
So why isn't it ちゅうこく？This is due to a phenomenon known as "rendaku" or "sequential voicing." Syllables that come later in a word are sometimes voiced and marked with a dakuten. This is often rather unpredictable, so rendaku words should be memorized individually

The following table shows six simple kanji with their accompanying kunyomi and onyomi reading:

**Kanji** | **Meaning**  | **Kunyomi Reading** | **Onyomi Reading**
----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------
人         | Person       | ひと                | じん、にん
中         | Middle       | なか                | ちゅう
国         | Country      | くに                | こく
日         | Sun, Day     | ひ　                | にち、じつ
本         | Origin, Book | もと                | ほん
田         | Rice Paddy   | た　                | でん

### Caveats
You may have noticed that the word Japan, or 日本 is composed of the kanji meaning "sun" and "origin." This word was first adopted by the Chinese, and to them, Japan was off to the east, the place where the sun rose or "originated."
