## Overview
Japanese uses three different writing systems, **hiragana**, **katakana**, and **kanji**.

* **Hiragana** is the most basic Japanese syllabary. It's like an alphabet that uses syllables instead of individual sounds.
* **Katakana** is the syllabary used to write foreign words and some noises. Although it's different from hiragana, it represents the exact same
syllables.
* **Kanji** are Chinese characters used in the Japanese language to write individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Kanji are not phonetic, meaning you need to memorize each pronunciation individually.

## Introduction to Kanji
This article introduces the non-phonetic writing system of Japanese, **kanji**. Kanji literally means "Chinese characters," and they're used to build content words like nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

### Kanji Readings
A single kanji may be used to write one or more different words and thus the same character may be pronounced in different ways. In this way, kanji are said to have one or more different "readings". Deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence.

Kanji readings are categorized as either on'yomi (literally "sound reading", from Chinese) or kun'yomi (literally "meaning reading", native Japanese), and most characters have at least two readings; one on'yomi and one kun'yomi. Most often, a character will be used for both sound and meaning, and it is simply a matter of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents.

#### On'yomi (Japanese Reading)
The on'yomi is the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of a character. It was often previously referred to as translation reading, as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself, similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords.

On'yomi primarily occur in multi-kanji compound words, many of which are the result of the adoption, along with the kanji themselves, of Chinese words for concepts that either did not exist in Japanese or could not be articulated as elegantly using native words. This borrowing process is often compared to the English borrowings from Latin, Greek, and Norman French, since Chinese-borrowed terms are often more specialized, or considered to sound more erudite or formal, than their native counterparts (occupying a higher linguistic register).

#### Kun'yomi (Meaning Reading)
The kun'yomi is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native Japanese word that closely approximated the meaning of the Chinese character when it was introduced. As with on'yomi, there can be multiple kun'yomi for the same kanji, and some kanji have no kun'yomi at all.

For instance, the character for east, 東, has the on'yomi tō, from Middle Chinese tung. However, Japanese already had two words for "east": higashi and azuma. Thus the kanji 東 had the latter readings added as kun'yomi.

In a number of cases, multiple kanji were assigned to cover a single Japanese word. Typically when this occurs, the different kanji refer to specific shades of meaning. Sometimes the distinction is very clear, although not always. Difference of opinion in the meaning of a kanji results in the use of personal preference or by writing the word in hiragana. This latter strategy is frequently employed with more complex cases such as もと moto, which has at least five different kanji: 元, 基, 本, 下, and 素, the first three of which have only very subtle differences.

### Rendaku
For example, let's take the kanji for "country," 国。On its own, we use the Japanese "kunyomi" reading, くに。In Japanese, くに means "country." However, in compounds, we use the "onyomi" reading of こく。Therefore, China, 中国 or "middle country," is read as ちゅうごく。

So why isn't it ちゅうこく？This is due to a phenomenon known as "rendaku" or "sequential voicing." Syllables that come later in a word are sometimes voiced and marked with a dakuten. This is often rather unpredictable, so rendaku words should be memorized individually

The following table shows six simple kanji with their accompanying kunyomi and onyomi reading:

**Kanji** | **Meaning**  | **Onyomi Reading** | **Kunyomi Reading**
----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------
人         | Person       | じん、にん　          | ひと
中         | Middle       | ちゅう               | なか
国         | Country      | こく　               | くに
日         | Sun, Day     | にち、じつ　          | ひ
本         | Origin, Book | ほん　               | もと
田         | Rice Paddy   | でん　               | た

### Caveats
You may have noticed that the word Japan, or 日本 is composed of the kanji meaning "sun" and "origin." This word was first adopted by the Chinese, and to them, Japan was off to the east, the place where the sun rose or "originated."
