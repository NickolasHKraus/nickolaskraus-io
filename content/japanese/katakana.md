description: Katakana is a Japanese syllabary and one component of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana and kanji.
---

## Overview
Japanese uses three different writing systems, **katakana**, **katakana**, and **kanji**.

* **Hiragana** is the most basic Japanese syllabary. It's like an alphabet that uses syllables instead of individual sounds.
* **Katakana** is the syllabary used to write foreign words and some noises. Although it's different from katakana, it represents the exact same 
syllables.
* **Kanji** are Chinese characters used in the Japanese language to write individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Kanji are not phonetic, meaning you need to memorize each pronunciation individually.

## Introduction to Katakana
With one or two minor exceptions, each syllable (strictly mora) in the Japanese language is represented by one character, or kana, in each system. In contrast to the katakana syllabary, which is used for Japanese words not covered by kanji and for grammatical inflections, the katakana syllabary has a usage similar to italics in the English language. For example, if an English article were to reference "katakana", the author may italicize the word to denote that the word is foreign and the reader should treat it as such. In other words, katakana is used for transcription of foreign language words into Japanese and the writing of loan words (collectively *gairaigo*); for emphasis; to represent onomatopoeia; for technical and scientific terms; and for names of plants, animals, minerals, and often Japanese companies.

## Table of Katakana

The following table shows the gojūon ordering of katakana.

a      | i        | u        | e      | o
-------|----------|----------|--------|--------
ア  [a] | イ [i]   | ウ [ɯ]   | エ [e]  | オ [o]
カ [ka] | キ [ki]  | ク [kɯ]  | ケ [ke] | コ [ko]
サ [sa] | シ [ɕi]  | ス [sɯ]  | セ [se] | ソ [so]
タ [ta] | チ [tɕi] | ツ [tsɯ] | テ [te] | ト [to]
ナ [na] | ニ [ni]  | ヌ [nɯ]  | ネ [ne] | ノ [no]
ハ [ha] | ヒ [çi]  | フ [ɸɯ]  | ヘ [he] | ホ [ho]
マ [ma] | ミ [mi]  | ム [mɯ]  | メ [me] | モ [mo]
ヤ [ja] | 　       | ユ [jɯ]  | 　      | ヨ [jo]
ラ [ɾa] | リ [ɾi]  | ル [ɾɯ]  | レ [ɾe] | ロ [ɾo]
ワ [ɰa] |  　      | 　       |  　     | ヲ [o]
ン [n]  | 　       | 　       | 　      |

### Caveats

* ス	 can shorten to more of a [s] at the end of a word.
* へ is pronounced like [e] or "eh" as a particle.
* ン is pronounced like [m] when combined with a bilabial stop.

### Dakuten
Putting two little dashes or **dakuten** at the upper right corner of a katakana syllable voices the consonant. It changes the pronunciation of the katakana in the following way:

Without | With
--------|-------
カ (ka)  | ガ (ga)
サ (sa)  | ザ (za)
シ (shi) | ジ (ji)
タ (ta)  | ダ (da)
ツ (tsu) | ヅ (zu)
ハ (ha)  | バ (ba)

#### Table of Katakana with Dakuten

The following table shows the gojūon ordering of katakana with **dakuten**.

a      | i        | u        | e      | o
-------|----------|----------|--------|--------
ガ [ga] | ギ [gi]  | グ [gɯ]  | ゲ [ge] | ゴ [go]
ザ [za] | ジ [dʑi] | ズ [zɯ]  | ゼ [ze] | ゾ [zo]
ダ [da] | ヂ [dʑi] | ヅ [zɯ]  | デ [de] | ド [do]
バ [ba] | ビ [bi]  | ブ [bɯ]  | ベ [be] | ボ [bo]

Putting a little circle or **handakuten** at the upper right corner changes the pronunciation of the ハ, ヒ, フ, ヘ, ホ katakana in the following way:

Without | With
--------|-------
ハ (ha)  | パ (pa)
ヒ (hi)  | ピ (pi)
フ (fu)  | プ (pu)
ヘ (he)  | ペ (pe)
ホ (ho)  | ポ (po)

#### Table of Katakana with Handakuten

The following table shows the gojūon ordering of katakana with **handakuten**.

a      | i        | u        | e      | o
-------|----------|----------|--------|--------
パ [pa] | ピ [pi]  | プ [pɯ]  | ペ [pe] | ポ [po]

### Big and Small Characters
Putting a ッ (small tsu), called a sokuon, between two katakana syllables geminates (doubles) the letter right after ッ and introduces a short pause between two sounds. The sokuon also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a glottal stop. Geminated consonants are common in transliterations of foreign loanwords; for example English "bed" is represented as ベッド (beddo). It cannot, however, be used to double the *na*, *ni*, *nu*, *ne*, *no* syllables' consonants – to double these, the singular n (ン) is added in front of the syllable. The sokuon may also be used to approximate a non-native sound: Bach is written バッハ (Bahha); Mach as マッハ (Mahha). See some examples below:

Big             | Small
----------------|--------------
サカ (saka)      | サッカ (sakka)

A small ヤ, ユ, or ヨ, or yōon, changes the pronunciation of a word in the following way:

Big         | Small
------------|---------
キヤ [ki-ya] | キャ [kya]
キユ [ki-yu] | キュ [kyu]
キヨ [ki-yo] | キョ [kyo]

The small character changes the two-syllable construction into a one-syllable construction. This changes the *i* vowel sound to a glide, the method of palatalization, to *a*, *u* or *o*. Sometimes, the difference can lead to a real change in meaning.
