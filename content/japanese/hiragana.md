description: Hiragana is a Japanese syllabary and one component of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana and kanji.
---

## Overview
Japanese uses three different writing systems, **hiragana**, **katakana**, and **kanji**.

* **Hiragana** is the most basic Japanese syllabary. It's like an alphabet that uses syllables instead of individual sounds.
* **Katakana** is the syllabary used to write foreign words and some noises. Although it's different from hiragana, it represents the exact same
syllables.
* **Kanji** are Chinese characters used in the Japanese language to write individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Kanji are not phonetic, meaning you need to memorize each pronunciation individually.

## Introduction to Hiragana
With one or two minor exceptions, each sound in the Japanese language (strictly, each *mora*) is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. Hiragana is a phonetic lettering system, meaning the characters do not represent single consonants and is therefore referred to as syllabary and not an alphabet.

Hiragana is used to write okurigana (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose.

## Table of Hiragana

The following table shows the gojūon ordering of hiragana.

a      | i        | u        | e      | o
-------|----------|----------|--------|--------
あ  [a] | い [i]   | う [ɯ]   | え [e]  | お [o]
か [ka] | き [ki]  | く [kɯ]  | け [ke] | こ [ko]
さ [sa] | し [ɕi]  | す [sɯ]  | せ [se] | そ [so]
た [ta] | ち [tɕi] | つ [tsɯ] | て [te] | と [to]
な [na] | に [ni]  | ぬ [nɯ]  | ね [ne] | の [no]
は [ha] | ひ [çi]  | ふ [ɸɯ]  | へ [he] | ほ [ho]
ま [ma] | み [mi]  | む [mɯ]  | め [me] | も [mo]
や [ja] | 　       | ゆ [jɯ]  | 　      | よ [jo]
ら [ɾa] | り [ɾi]  | る [ɾɯ]  | れ [ɾe] | ろ [ɾo]
わ [ɰa] |  　      | 　       |  　     | を [o]
ん [n]  | 　       | 　       | 　      |

### Caveats

* す can shorten to more of a [s] at the end of a word.
* は is pronounced like [ɰa] or "wa" as a particle.
* へ is pronounced like [e] or "eh" as a particle.
* ん is pronounced like [m] when combined with a bilabial stop.

### Dakuten
Putting two little dashes or **dakuten** at the upper right corner of a hiragana syllable voices the consonant. It changes the pronunciation of the hiragana in the following way:

Without | With
--------|-------
か (ka)  | が (ga)
さ (sa)  | ざ (za)
し (shi) | じ (ji)
た (ta)  | だ (da)
つ (tsu) | づ (zu)
は (ha)  | ば (ba)

#### Table of Hiragana with Dakuten

The following table shows the gojūon ordering of hiragana with **dakuten**.

a      | i        | u        | e      | o
-------|----------|----------|--------|--------
が [ga] | ぎ [gi]  | ぐ [gɯ]  | げ [ge] | ご [go]
ざ [za] | じ [dʑi] | ず [zɯ]  | ぜ [ze] | ぞ [zo]
だ [da] | ぢ [dʑi] | づ [zɯ]  | で [de] | ど [do]
ば [ba] | び [bi]  | ぶ [bɯ]  | べ [be] | ぼ [bo]

Putting a little circle or **handakuten** at the upper right corner changes the pronunciation of the は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ hiragana in the following way:

Without | With
--------|-------
は (ha)  | ぱ (pa)
ひ (hi)  | ぴ (pi)
ふ (fu)  | ぷ (pu)
へ (he)  | ぺ (pe)
ほ (ho)  | ぽ (po)

#### Table of Hiragana with Handakuten

The following table shows the gojūon ordering of hiragana with **handakuten**.

a      | i        | u        | e      | o
-------|----------|----------|--------|--------
ぱ [pa] | ぴ [pi]  | ぷ [pɯ]  | ぺ [pe] | ぽ [po]

### Big and Small Characters
Putting a っ (small tsu), called a sokuon, between two hiragana syllables geminates (doubles) the letter right after っ and introduces a short pause between two sounds. The sokuon also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a glottal stop. It cannot, however, be used to double the *na*, *ni*, *nu*, *ne*, *no* syllables' consonants – to double these, the singular n (ん) is added in front of the syllable. See some examples below:

Big             | Small
----------------|--------------
きて (kite)      | きって (kitte)
もと (moto)      | もっと (motto)
あさり (asari)   | あっさり (assari)

A small や, ゆ, or よ, or yōon, changes the pronunciation of a word in the following way:

Big         | Small
------------|---------
きや [ki-ya] | きゃ [kya]
きゆ [ki-yu] | きゅ [kyu]
きよ [ki-yo] | きょ [kyo]

The small character changes the two-syllable construction into a one-syllable construction. This changes the *i* vowel sound to a glide, the method of palatalization, to *a*, *u* or *o*. Sometimes, the difference can lead to a real change in meaning. For example, びよういん with a big よ means beauty salon, while びょういん with a small ょ means hospital.

### Caveats

A う after a “u” or “o” makes the sound longer.

きゅう | kyū

**Example**: ありがとう
