Hello! My name is Nickolas Kraus. I live in the beautiful city of Ames, Iowa. I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com) and Founder at [Infrable](https://infrable.io). I love solving problems, self-experimentation and researching various interests. This blog is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way.
